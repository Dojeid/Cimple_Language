# Cimple

Cimple is a performance-oriented programming language designed with Python-like syntax and systems-level capability in mind.

This repository contains the compiler toolchain, featuring a handwritten recursive-descent parser and our evolving backend architecture.

## Current Status

**Cimple v0.5** introduces significant stability and logic improvements:

- **Enhanced Parser:** Support for complex nested expressions and scoping.
- **Initial Semantic Layer:** Basic type checking and variable validation.
- **Control Flow:** Optimized `while` loops and `if/elif/else` branching.
- **Memory Management:** Preliminary logic for stack allocation.
- **Literals:** Expanded support for hex, binary, and escape sequences.

This milestone marks the transition from a syntax-focused experiment to a functional language frontend.

## Design Goals

- Clean Python-style syntax
- Predictable performance
- **LLVM-based backend** (In Progress)
- Low-level control without syntactic noise
- Minimal core language, extensible by design

## Roadmap

The next major focus areas:

- Full LLVM IR generation for native execution
- Advanced Type Inference system
- Standard Library (Cimple StdLib)
- GPU programming extensions
- Cross-platform support (Linux/macOS)

Cimple is currently in active development. Expect rapid iterations.

Building a language is a long-term systems engineering effort.  
**Cimple v0.5** is the bridge to native performance.
